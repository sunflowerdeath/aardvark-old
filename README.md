# Aardvark

Aardvark is library for creating cross platform applications.

Aardvark does not wrap native controls or use web view, everything is rendered
from scratch with its own GUI rendering engine.
It is written in C++ and uses Skia library for hardware-accelerated 2D graphics.
Such approach makes possible to get exactly expected result on various 
platforms.

Goal of this project is to allow developers to control by themselves how their
applications should work, and not depend on the features and limitations of
different platforms.

Currently it is under development and not ready for use.
