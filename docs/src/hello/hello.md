# About Aardvark

Aardvark is a library for creating cross-platform applications for desktop and 
mobile devices using JavaScript and React.

Aardvark includes own GUI rendering engine written in C++ that uses Skia library
for hardware-accelerated 2D graphics. It does not use system controls or web 
view, everything is rendered from scratch. Such approach makes possible to get 
exactly expected result on all platforms.

Goal of this project is to allow developers to control by themselves how their 
applications should work, and not depend on the features and limitations of 
different platforms.
